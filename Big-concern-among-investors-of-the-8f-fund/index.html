            <h3 class="space">Investors are impatiently waiting for 8f Assets Management to take concrete steps to implement the RAS technologies they were promised.<h3>
      
            <h5 class="space text">The uncertain climate around Pure Salmon results from 8F revealing no plans on the near horizon to implement any form of RAS project.</h5>
          
      <h5 class="space text">To date absolutely no farm has been built although according to the promises of 8F and Pure Salmon there should have already been a production of 10,000 tons of salmon by now. It's been over four years since investors sent funds destined for the construction and operation of an annual 10,000 metric-ton RAS to 8F. Follow up of their promised schedule reveals that investors should receive a multiple of eight times their investment after eight years. That leaves little time.</h5>
          
      <h5 class="space text">To add to the incertitude surrounding Pure Salmon, Aquamaof, who builds Ras technology has severed ties with 8F so the question that arises is who will be the builder of Ras technology for 8f. Aquamaof has also ended the partnership with Pure Salmon in a small on-land salmon farm in Poland. Aquamaof will solely be taking over. Now that Pure Salmon is excluded even from this small RAS project, Pure Salmon can no longer be considered an actor in RAS.</h5>
          
      <h5 class="space text">In a move to no doubt reassure investors with action, 8f has invested in Norway-based company Krüger Kaldnes but this company is very far from the aspirations of 8f as they are simply smolt producers. This is a very far cry from the land-based operation of 10,000 metric tons that was promised.</h5>
      
      <h5 class="space text">Pure Salmon bought a salmon processing company in Capécure, Ïod in the Boulonnais region last year. This company smokes salmon with a traditional recipe that smells more of a caterer service and is not up to par with promises made by Stephane Farouze, Founder & Chairman of 8F and Pure Salmon to investors to become the largest producer of R.A.S. in the world and to provide an annual production of 280,000 tons.</h5>
      
      <h5 class="space text">The press is also starting to pick up on this lack of promised action.
        It is pointed out in the article published in the Voix du Nord dated January 23rd 2022, that absolutely no concrete steps have been taken by Pure Salmon in developing RAS projects. The title clamors in French
        “Where are the intensive salmon farming projects in the Boulonnais?” It continues to question at what rhythm are Pure Salmon projects advancing for RAS or intensive salmon farming projects in the Boulonnais? Very slowly…

        </h5>
      <h5 class="space text">The magazine la Semaine also points out that the closed circuit salmon farming project has stalled in the article. <a href="https://lasemainedansleboulonnais.nordlittoral.fr/135290/article/2022-01-24/pure-salmon-encore-loin-de-landacres-mais-deja-dans-les-rayons">Article link here.</a></h5>
      <h5 class="space text">Their proposed installation of Pure Salmon in Boulogne-sur-Mer was met with protestors who are petitioning against this project criticizing the massive consumption of water and energy of intensive fish farming breeding as well as the onset of pollution and animal suffering and the artificialization of agricultural land caused by this type of project. https://therasblog.com/Demonstrations-against-Pure-Salmon-in-France
        If they had to choose the inhabitants of the region have a marked preference for the other aquaculture project Local Ocean and this one seems to be advancing well. Local Ocean has  advantage of using salt water.<a href=" https://lasemainedansleboulonnais.nordlittoral.fr/126291/article/2021-10-01/boulogne-local-ocean-l-autre-projet-d-aquaculture-avance">Article link here</a>

    <section>
      <h3 class="space">The asset manager 8F has been focusing on RAS projects through its division Pure Salmon. Investors are attracted by sustainable investments which explains why land-based aquaculture has been attracting more investors. 8F has raised over 350 million dollars coming from various investors wishing to build centers equipped with RAS technology. Over 100$ million dollars come from investors of Brunei.<h3>

      <h5 class="space text">These funds are destined for the construction and operation of an annual 10,000 metric-ton recirculating aquaculture system facility in Brunei. One of the partners of this facility is the Strategic Development Investment Fund, which is a fund lying within the scope of responsibility of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. </h5>
    
<h5 class ="space text">Brunei and other investors have followed 8F's assurances to invest in RAS. Unfortunately 8F investments and promises depend on Aquamaof who has just severed ties with 8F and Pure Salmom and will not be supporting them or their investors. Aquamaof offers the most advanced RAS technology but will not be supplying this technology to 8F's investors.</h5>

         <h5 class="space text">8F undelined its partnership with Aquamaof to encourage investors to fund RAS projects. Aquamaof has never built an aquaculture farm for Pure Salmon and no longer has any agreement with this company. Now 8F is left with a large sum of money received from investors and no technology vendor capable of responding to the building of such large RAS farms.
