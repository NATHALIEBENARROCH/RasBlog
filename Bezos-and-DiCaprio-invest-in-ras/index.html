      <h5 class="space text">It may come as a surprise to many that both Jeff Bezos and Leonardo DiCaprio
        have invested over 100 million$ investment into the cell-cultured salmon company WildType based in San Fransisco.
        </h5>
    
<h5 class="space text">Friends share good opportunities with friends and these two have been close for a while. It is true that all the socialite newspapers talked about how Jeff Bezos’ partner, Lauren Sanchez, was admiring Leonardo Dicaprio at a Gala after a video catching the moment went viral. But Bezos must not be the type of man to feel threatened. After all it was DiCaprio who invited them both to the LACMA Art + Film gala. DiCaprio and girlfriend Camila Morrone were also seen vacationing with the Bezos- Sanchez couple. 
  So evidently good friend share tips and that is how they have jointly contributed to the is the biggest investment ever made to date into a cellular aquaculture company. They also included Cargill and Robert Downey, Jr in this project.   
  </h5>
    
<h5 class="space text">The contributions come from a wide range of domains:  environmental, health, institutional, retail and research communities all have the common goal of commercializing more sustainable seafood options.
  This investment will benefit the brand Wildtype which will play a leading role starting with salmon.
  Especially with an ambassador like Leonardo DiCaprio and here we quote him directly ““Wild fish populations are threatened more than ever before. Wildtype is the clear leader in cultivated seafood, which will give us the chance to protect our oceans while creating the cleanest seafood on the planet. Wildtype will surely transform the food system with its incredible salmon.”
  </h5>

  <h5 class="space text">Recently Wildtype has “worked to innovate across product development, process design, and research and development to improve the taste, texture, and appearance of its cultivated salmon, which has earned unprecedented accolades from world-renowned chefs,” according to the company.
    Wildtype is close to getting their products to market and will expand to become the leader in this field.    
    </h5>

    <h5 class="space text">Since being founded in 2016 Wildtype has already raised over 120 million dollars. This investment will allow Wildtype to grow their  production in order to match the increasing demand for seafood that is environmentally friendly and free of mercury and microplastic
      and will help protect oceans.
