      <h3 class="space">Investors are impatiently waiting for 8f Assets Management to take concrete steps to implement the RAS technologies they were promised.<h3>

      <h5 class="space text">The uncertain climate around Pure Salmon results from 8F revealing no plans on the near horizon to implement any form of RAS project.</h5>
    
<h5 class="space text">To date absolutely no farm has been built although according to the promises of 8F and Pure Salmon there should have already been a production of 10,000 tons of salmon by now. It's been over four years since investors sent funds destined for the construction and operation of an annual 10,000 metric-ton RAS to 8F. Follow up of their promised schedule reveals that investors should receive a multiple of eight times their investment after eight years. That leaves little time.</h5>
    
<h5 class="space text">To add to the incertitude surrounding Pure Salmon, Aquamaof, who builds Ras technology has severed ties with 8F so the question that arises is who will be the builder of Ras technology for 8f. Aquamaof has also ended the partnership with Pure Salmon in a small on-land salmon farm in Poland. Aquamaof will solely be taking over. Now that Pure Salmon is excluded even from this small RAS project, Pure Salmon can no longer be considered an actor in RAS.</h5>
    
<h5 class="space text">In a move to no doubt reassure investors with action, 8f has invested in Norway-based company Krüger Kaldnes but this company is very far from the aspirations of 8f as they are simply smolt producers. This is a very far cry from the land-based operation of 10,000 metric tons that was promised.</h5>

<h5 class="space text">Pure Salmon bought a salmon processing company in Capécure, Ïod in the Boulonnais region last year. This company smokes salmon with a traditional recipe that smells more of a caterer service and is not up to par with promises made by Stephane Farouze, Founder & Chairman of 8F and Pure Salmon to investors to become the largest producer of R.A.S. in the world and to provide an annual production of 280,000 tons.</h5>

<h5 class="space text">The press is also starting to pick up on this lack of promised action.
  It is pointed out in the article published in the Voix du Nord dated January 23rd 2022, that absolutely no concrete steps have been taken by Pure Salmon in developing RAS projects. The title clamors in French
  “Where are the intensive salmon farming projects in the Boulonnais?” It continues to question at what rhythm are Pure Salmon projects advancing for RAS or intensive salmon farming projects in the Boulonnais? Very slowly…

  </h5>
<h5 class="space text">The magazine la Semaine also points out that the closed circuit salmon farming project has stalled in the article. <a href="https://lasemainedansleboulonnais.nordlittoral.fr/135290/article/2022-01-24/pure-salmon-encore-loin-de-landacres-mais-deja-dans-les-rayons">Article link here.</a></h5>
<h5 class="space text">Their proposed installation of Pure Salmon in Boulogne-sur-Mer was met with protestors who are petitioning against this project criticizing the massive consumption of water and energy of intensive fish farming breeding as well as the onset of pollution and animal suffering and the artificialization of agricultural land caused by this type of project. https://therasblog.com/Demonstrations-against-Pure-Salmon-in-France
  If they had to choose the inhabitants of the region have a marked preference for the other aquaculture project Local Ocean and this one seems to be advancing well. Local Ocean has  advantage of using salt water.<a href=" https://lasemainedansleboulonnais.nordlittoral.fr/126291/article/2021-10-01/boulogne-local-ocean-l-autre-projet-d-aquaculture-avance">Article link here</a>

    <h3 class="space">Like all sustainable development projects, RAS or recirculating aquaculture systems are attracting world-wide investors and wealth management organizations because of the key word sustainable. But besides key words 8F has little to show. Investors are starting to wonder if 8f is up to the task at hand with these numerous obstacles and their lack of any proof of concept in a field that has little room for missteps and lack of experience. Understandably, investors who have invested in the 8F fund are getting impatient with the way things are going.
